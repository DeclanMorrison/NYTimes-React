# NYTimes-React

## This is a full stack MERN news scraper application.

**It uses Node.js, Express and Mongoose** in the backend to serve files, and get, save and delete articles. It also uses React in the front end to provide a smooth and _reactive_ single page application.

**A use case for this application** is to search for a specific article based off topic, and time range. Moreover, it demonstrates a good understanding of full stack development, including new and relevant technologies like react.

**To use this application**, you can visit the deployed site [here](https://safe-savannah-41311.herokuapp.com/).
